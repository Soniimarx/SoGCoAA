Simulation of Ground Control of an Airborne Attack

Write a program that spawns and controls multiple processes. The program should use system calls to create, manage and terminate the processes. The program should use signal system calls to communicate between the processes. The processes should coordinate a simple command structure where the main process is the “base” and its child processes are “planes”. The base process is the main process. It should run in a simple loop, prompting the user for an input command. Valid input commands are,

• launch
• bomb
• refuel
• quit

The bomb and refuel commands each require one(1) argument, the others do not require any. You may use any variation on the commands, for example “L” for launch instead of the full word. Invalid commands should produce a suitable error message, including those described below. Upon receiving the command to quit, the program should terminate. The launch command should create a child process i.e. a plane to take off. Once launched all child processes should execute the following (same) code”

• A child process i.e. a “plane” should execute a loop, counting its available quantity of “fuel” downward, beginning at 100. It loses fuel at a rate of 5 units/second

• Every 3 seconds a plane must report to the base its fuel status by printing the line “Bomber N to base, #% of fuel left,” where N is the child’s process ID (which as we know, is an integer)

• When the bomb command is entered the base first checks whether or not any planes were launched. If there were, it prompts for the plane’s (process) ID and sends the plane with process ID N, the SIGUSR1 signal. Upon receiving this signal the plane with ID N should print the line “Bomber N to base, bombs away!”. If no planes were launched the message “No planes are flying, can’t drop a bomb!” must be printed

• When the refuel command is entered the base first checks whether or not any planes were launched. If there were, it prompts for the plane’s ID and sends the plane with process ID N, the SIGUSR2 signal. The child process should “refuel” by resetting its fuel value to 100 and printing the message “Plane N has been refueled”, where N is the plane’s (process) ID

• When a plane’s fuel reaches zero (or less), it should print the message “SoS! Plane N is going to crash”, again where N is the plane’s (process) ID, and then it exits

The base (parent process) should therefore be able to “know” that at least 1 plane (child process) has been created. To properly demonstrate that your code works, it must be able to manage a minimum of 2 planes (child processes). Remember that the use of the user-defined signals i.e. SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2, means that you must write signal handlers for them in your code. Below are samples of the output that depict how
the program should work and that it manages (more than) the minimum required number of processes.
